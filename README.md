#Ionic-App-OAuth


Sample Ionic Application that uses Ionic-OAuth https://github.com/organizations/savyasoft/Ionic-OAuth


##Create Ionic app for this service

* create an ionic application. ( ionicframework.com/docs/guide/starting.html  )
* Replace the templates ( folder ) , js ( folse ) and index.html files should be replaced in your ionic application's www folder.
* Replace the bower.json in your ionic application.

##Adding Bower Dependancies

Installig all bower libraries specified in bower.json file. 

```
bower install;
```

(or)

```
bower install angular-cookies;

bower install ionic-oauth;
```

All bower libraries are installed by default other than "angular-cookies"  and "ionic-oauth" .
So it is sufficient to install only those dependancies.
